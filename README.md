Berkebun+ is a smart application designed to help farmers and plant lovers detect plant diseases quickly and accurately. Using image recognition technology, Berkebun+ allows users to upload photos of problematic plant leaves. The application will analyze the image to identify diseases that may attack the plant, display the results in the form of disease names, and provide appropriate treatment recommendations.

Berkebun+ was developed as part of a final project to meet the graduation requirements of the Bangkit 2024 program in collaboration with Google, GoTo, and Traveloka. This project integrates various technologies, such as Cloud Computing, Machine Learning, and Mobile Development, to create innovative solutions that have a real impact on society, especially in the agricultural sector.
